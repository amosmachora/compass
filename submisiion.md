## Inspiration

So we all are engineers (hopefully) and at some point during the budding stages of our careers we struggled to find information on what to read where to read it. The information on youtube was either too much, leading to decision paralysis, covered too complex topics for our still growing programming knowledge or vice versa.

## What it does

Compass is a platform built by software engineers for software engineers. The zen is that the engineering community knows engineering more than anyone else. So the project on experienced developers to scour resources on the internet and provide one single source of truth where people can learn with as little confusion as possible. You can sign in and create learning paths on which you have expertise . Create resources on that expertise and a young engineer somewhere looking for the same data will thank you.

## How we built it

We built the project using NextJS, Convex, Typescript plus many more tools. Faiso created the landing page , Damsel created the interest page then Amos & Kelly created the dashboard.

## Challenges we ran into

Challenge 1. Time. 24 - 8 hours is so little to build a complex project as this but we pushed it as far as we could.

Challenge 2. Working online with teammates from all over the world is no picnic. Technology and experience differences did not help at all.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

The app works! You can check it out yourself. Although there are some features we should include such as profanity checkers and edit functionalities, the proof of concept is rolling.

## What we learned

Work as a team.

## What's next for Compass

For now we really do not know. After the hackathon we welcome contributors to help us push the project further into the skies.
